# Yet Another Rock Paper Scissors Silly Game
This file contains the basic solution to an exercise we presented
a few days ago for our mentoring program members for them to build.

The time has come for them to review with us their solutions and
compare it with this repo, being a very simple approach but aiming to
reach the below requirements for this game:

#### BOOTSTRAP 5 & JavaScript Challenge

**Create a Rock, Scissors, Paper Dynamic Game in JavaScript**

> Apply your acquired knowledge to design a game dashboard with an intuitive flow and UI. Use creativity and imagination to recreate the rock, paper, scissors game, displaying images of the player's and computer's choices, and indicating the winner of each turn. Use all resources to create a clean and attractive design. Let's give our best to achieve this new challenge, Tribe!

Rock, Paper, Scissors is a simple hand game played between two people or in this case, against the computer. Each player simultaneously forms one of three shapes with an outstretched hand. The possible shapes are rock (a fist), paper (a flat hand), and scissors (a fist with the index and middle fingers extended, forming a V). The game has three possible outcomes: a draw, where both players choose the same shape, or a win/loss scenario based on the chosen shapes. Emojis can be used on this approach to simplify the need of artwork creation. Although both code and UI are important, We are aiming functionality instead of UI.

Instructions:

- Click any of the buttons to make your choice (rock, paper, or scissors).
- The computer will randomly select its choice.
- The results (win, lose, or draw) will be displayed below along with the current score for both the player and the computer.
